# Changelog

## v0.6.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.02 and OTP 23.2.7. If you have made a
custom system off this one, please review the `nerves_system_br v1.15.0` release
notes.

The Nerves toolchain has also been updated to v1.4.2. This brings in Linux 4.14
headers to enable use of cdev and eBPF. This won't affect most users.

## v0.5.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2020.11.2, GCC 10.2 and OTP 23.2.4.

When migrating custom systems based, please be aware of the following important
changes:

* There's a new `getrandom` syscall that is made early in BEAM startup. This has
  the potential to block the BEAM before Nerves can start `rngd` to provide
  entropy. We have not seen this issue here, but have updated `erlinit.config`
  for the time being as a precaution.
* The GCC 10.2.0 toolchain has a different name that calls out "nerves" as the
  vendor and the naming is now more consistent with other toolchain providers.
* Experimental support for tooling that requires more information about the
  target has been added. The initial support focuses on zigler.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.14.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.14.4)

    path differences in firmware images. This helps delta firmware updates.

## v0.4.0

This release updates to [Buildroot
2020.08](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2020-September/290797.html) and OTP 23.1.1.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.13.2](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.13.2)
  * [Erlang/OTP 23.1.1](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.1.1.README)
  * [erlinit 1.8.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/erlinit/releases/tag/v1.8.0)
  * [nerves 1.7.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves/releases/tag/v1.7.0)

* New features
  * Added support for updating the root filesystem using firmware patches.
    See the [firmware patch docs](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/experimental-features.html#content) for more information.

## v0.3.2

This release updates to [Buildroot
2020.05.1](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2020-July/287824.html)
and OTP 23.0.3 which are both bug fix releases.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br: bump to v1.12.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.12.4)
  * [Erlang/OTP 23.0.3](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.0.3.README)
  * [nerves_heart v0.3.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_heart/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

* New features
  * The `/data` directory now exists for storing application-specific data. It
    is currently a symlink to `/root`. Using `/data` will eventually be
    encouraged over `/root` even though currently there is no advantage. This
    change makes it possible to start migrating paths in applications and
    libraries.

* Fixes
  * Fixed old references to the `-Os` compiler flag. All C/C++ code will default
    to using `-O2` now.

## v0.3.1

* Fixes
  * Remove `nerves_system_linter` from hex package. This fixes mix dependency
    errors in projects that reference systems with different
    `nerves_system_linter` dependency specs.

## v0.3.0

This release updates the system to use Buildroot 2020.05 and Erlang/OTP 23.
Please see the respective release notes for updates and deprecations in both
projects for changes that may affect your application.
